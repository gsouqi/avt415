    <h1>What is Oatmilk?</h1>
    <p>Oat milk is a popular dairy-free, vegan-friendly milk substitute. It’s made by soaking and blending steel-cut or rolled oats with water and then straining them through cheesecloth to separate the milk from the oats.</p>
    <h2>Is Oat Milk Good for You?</h2>
    <p>Naturally, oat milk isn’t as nutritious as whole oats. As a result, it’s often enriched with nutrients including calcium, potassium, iron, and vitamins A and D. Oat milk is unique in that it’s free of many of the allergens found in other types of milk. Plus, it contains beta-glucans, a soluble fiber that may offer heart health benefits.</p>
